Introduction "Hello World" example

This example repository was made by following along with the guide on github in order to learn how git works and how to use it.
I am fairly new to programming as I learned a little bit in college but now I am here to further my knowledge and experience about programming and version control with github. My main languages I have learned are C, assembly, and very little python and javascript. I hope to broaden my reach in programming and learn how to use it to the best of my abilities to write programs and apps.
